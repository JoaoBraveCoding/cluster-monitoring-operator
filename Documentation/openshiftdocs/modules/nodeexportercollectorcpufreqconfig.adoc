== NodeExporterCollectorCpufreqConfig

=== Description

The `NodeExporterCollectorCpufreqConfig` resource works as an on/off switch for the `cpufreq` collector of the `node-exporter` agent. By default, the `cpufreq` collector is disabled. Under certain circumstances, enabling the cpufreq collector increases CPU usage on machines with many cores. If you enable this collector and have machines with many cores, monitor your systems closely for excessive CPU usage. Please refer to https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/issues/1880 for more details. A related bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1972076
